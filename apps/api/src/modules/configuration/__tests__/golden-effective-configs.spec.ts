/**
 * PHASE-015 §6 golden effective-configs (CONFIGURATION_ENGINE §10 #2):
 * one pinned, hashed effective config per shipped template × plan ×
 * jurisdiction example — the twelve v1.0.0 manifests (retail / grocery /
 * restaurant + the PHASE-017 automotive / distribution pair + the
 * PHASE-018 food manufacturing template + the PHASE-019 professional
 * services template + the PHASE-032 education template + the PHASE-033
 * agriculture template + the PHASE-030 wholesale / electronics pair +
 * the PHASE-031 healthcare commercial shell — the two lineages' template
 * sets united by the restoration merge) × the plan seeds
 * (migration 0008/0021/0024/0025/0026/0027 + the PHASE-027 0038 grants)
 * × the SA jurisdiction seed (migration 0013, pack 1.0.0-baseline, VAT in
 * force, registered tenant).
 *
 * A resolution change that alters any golden hash fails CI unless the
 * change is a reviewed decision — that is this spec's entire job. The
 * structural assertions beside each pin exist so a mismatch is debuggable,
 * not so they can substitute for the pin.
 *
 * PHASE-044 review note: 27 pins re-pinned — two reviewed changes moved
 * them together. (1) Migration 0071 §3 grants the eight WMS feature keys
 * (inventory.wms/putaway/picking/cycle_counts/abc/serial_ledger/
 * quarantine/consignment) to business + enterprise (the 0066 precedent)
 * — the L4 layer folds plan feature_keys, so every business/enterprise
 * row moves. (2) Migration 0071 §4 appends the eight keys to the
 * distribution-bearing templates' REQUIRED chains (industry.distribution
 * + industry.wholesale manifests — the contracts copy moved in T-01),
 * so their STARTER rows move too (the starter plan does not grant the
 * keys: the WMS surface resolves degraded-missing, the honest starter
 * posture). The layer-fixtures transcribe the 0071 §3 block; the pins
 * were recomputed by re-running the compose pipeline over the post-0071
 * fixtures (the 039/042 re-pin procedure).
 *
 * PHASE-042 review note: ALL 37 pins re-pinned — three reviewed changes moved
 * them together. (1) Migration 0066 §8 grants the six manufacturing-execution
 * feature keys (routing/work_centers/shopfloor/rework/downtime/standard_costs)
 * to business + enterprise (the 0026 precedent) — the L4 layer folds plan
 * feature_keys, so those rows move. (2) feature-catalog.ts registers the six
 * FEATURE_DEPS edges (work_centers leaf · routing → item_master + work_centers
 * · shopfloor → routing + work_centers · rework → production_orders ·
 * downtime → work_centers · standard_costs → bom + routing) — the dependency
 * closure is hashed content. (3) The downtime_posting SETTINGS_REGISTRY key
 * lands in every tenant's policy map as a platform default (BR-070 — the
 * PHASE-018 all-moved precedent). Every pin was recomputed by running the
 * compose pipeline over the post-0065/0066 seeds (the old→new table lives in
 * the PHASE-042-COMPLETION report; recorded per the P32/039 re-pin procedure).
 *
 * PHASE-039 review note: ALL 37 pins re-pinned — two reviewed changes moved
 * them together. (1) Migration 0056 §10 grants the four returns &
 * collections keys (sales.rma, sales.warranties, sales.dunning,
 * purchasing.rma) to business + enterprise — the L4 layer folds plan
 * feature_keys, so those rows move; the composed policy map folds the
 * full plan registry, which is why the starter rows move with them (the
 * PHASE-018 all-moved precedent). (2) feature-catalog.ts gains the four
 * FEATURE_DEPS edges (sales.rma→sales.invoices · sales.warranties→
 * sales.rma · sales.dunning→sales.receivables_aging · purchasing.rma→
 * purchasing.goods_receipts) — the dependency closure is hashed content.
 * Every pin was recomputed by running the compose pipeline over the
 * post-0056 seeds (the old→new table lives in the PHASE-039-COMPLETION
 * report; recorded per the P32 re-pin procedure).
 *
 * PHASE-017 review note: the business/enterprise pins were re-pinned with
 * the 0025 plan grants (sales.job_cards + the distribution/commission set
 * + inventory.reservations on business) — the L4 layer is part of the
 * hashed content, so the reviewed seed change moves exactly those pins.
 *
 * PHASE-018 review note: every pin moved — the 0026 plan grants added the
 * seven manufacturing keys to business (enterprise already had them;
 * starter untouched), and the four manufacturing SETTINGS_REGISTRY keys
 * (qc_gate/scrap_reason_required/fg_batch_expiry_from_shelf_life/
 * consumption_variance_threshold_pct) land in every tenant's policy map
 * as platform defaults (SETTINGS_REGISTRY defaults are the lowest rung of
 * the hashed §5 policies). The three new food_manufacturing rows pin with
 * the rest.
 *
 * PHASE-019 review note: every pin moved again — the 0027 plan grants
 * added the six CRM+projects keys to business (enterprise already had
 * them; starter untouched), and the SEVEN new SETTINGS_REGISTRY keys (the
 * six crm.* policy keys + the platform-only crm.defer_advance_recognition)
 * land in every tenant's policy map as platform defaults (the §5 policies
 * map is part of the hashed content). The old→new table is recorded in
 * agent-ctx/T43-2-template.md; the three new professional_services rows
 * pin with the rest.
 *
 * PHASE-028 review note (restored lineage): every pin moved again — the
 * two SETTINGS_REGISTRY budgeting control keys (budgeting.controls.mode +
 * budgeting.controls.warn_threshold_percent, BR-051 — advisory-by-default
 * policy) land in every tenant's policy map as platform defaults, so all
 * pins re-pinned in-phase (the P28-A settings-key wave; the migration
 * 0042 plan grants add the six budgeting feature keys to business+
 * enterprise, moving those pins a second notch). Starter carries only the
 * policy-default shift (no new grants). Recorded in
 * agent-ctx/P28-B-budgeting-core.md.
 *
 * PHASE-029 review note (restored lineage): every pin moved again — the
 * four SETTINGS_REGISTRY payroll policy keys (payroll.loans.max_deduction_
 * percent / payroll.loans.control_account_id / payroll.eos.enabled /
 * payroll.eos.accrual_days_per_service_year, BR-054/BR-055) land in every
 * tenant's policy map as platform defaults, so all pins re-pinned
 * in-phase (the P29-A settings-key wave; the migration 0043 plan grants
 * add the eight payroll feature keys to business+enterprise, moving those
 * pins a second notch — the same two-notch pattern as 028). Starter
 * carries only the policy-default shift (no new grants). Recorded in
 * agent-ctx/P29-B-payroll-core.md.
 *
 * PHASE-030 review note (restored lineage): the fifteen business/
 * enterprise pins (7 templates × business + 7 × enterprise + the
 * no-template business row) moved — the layer fixtures mirror the 0038
 * notes + installments grant wave (twelve keys → business + enterprise,
 * transcribed because the wholesale template's REQUIRED pdc_notes chain
 * consumes it; the P28/P29 grant waves stay un-mirrored per the recorded
 * posture). Starter rows unchanged. The six new wholesale/electronics
 * rows pin with the 0044 seeds. The old→new table is recorded in
 * agent-ctx/P30-A-contracts-migration.md.
 *
 * PHASE-032 review note: the fifteen business/enterprise pins + the
 * no-template row moved — the fixtures now transcribe the PHASE-027 0038
 * plan grants (the twelve notes/installments keys → business + enterprise,
 * migration 0038's own UPDATE; starter untouched — its seven pins are
 * byte-stable) because the education template's REQUIRED chain
 * (installments.plans/collections/late_fees) and OPTIONAL pdc_notes entry
 * resolve through exactly those grants; the 0035/0037 grant blocks stay
 * untranscribed (no shipped template consumes them). The six new
 * education POLICY_REGISTRY keys carry NO settingsKey mapping (the
 * deliberate no-SETTINGS_REGISTRY-surface choice — the L1 manifest
 * defaults land under their raw policy-key names, so non-education
 * tenants' policy maps and pins are byte-stable). The three new education
 * rows pin with the rest; every pin below was recomputed by running the
 * compose pipeline over the updated fixtures (recorded in the
 * PHASE-032-COMPLETION report; the old→new table lives in
 * agent-ctx/P32-T5-golden-pins.md).
 *
 * PHASE-033 review note: ZERO existing pins move — the first shipped
 * template whose REQUIRED chain resolves ENTIRELY through the
 * already-transcribed grants (manufacturing.bom/production_orders @ the
 * 0026 block, inventory.batch_tracking + accounting.cost_centers @ the
 * 0008 base, purchasing/sales @ the starter base, accounting.projects @
 * the 0027 block), so layer-fixtures is byte-identical to the PHASE-032
 * transcription; and the four new agriculture POLICY_REGISTRY keys carry
 * NO settingsKey mapping (the 0039 precedent), so non-agriculture
 * tenants' policy maps are untouched. All 25 existing pins re-verified
 * byte-stable by re-running the compose pipeline (the education ×
 * business spot check: 29e14755…f7cbc unchanged); the three new
 * agriculture rows pin with the rest (recorded in the
 * PHASE-033-COMPLETION report; the reviewed table lives in
 * agent-ctx/P33-T5-golden-pins.md).
 *
 * THE RESTORATION-MERGE review note: the stage-9/10 siblings 028–031
 * (budgeting / payroll / wholesale+electronics / healthcare) were
 * restored from the uploaded PHASE-031 archive and merged onto PHASE-034
 * — the twelve-template set is the union of the two lineages' rows (the
 * surviving lineage's education/agriculture rows + the restored
 * lineage's wholesale/electronics/healthcare rows), and the merged
 * SETTINGS_REGISTRY now carries the six 028/029 policy keys, so EVERY
 * pin (including the surviving lineage's 28) was recomputed by re-running
 * the compose pipeline over the merged fixtures — the same two-notch
 * 028/029 pattern the restored lineage recorded for its own rows, now
 * applied honestly to the united set. The wholesale/electronics/
 * healthcare pins carried over from the restored lineage are re-derived
 * under the merged tree (byte-identical inputs ⇒ byte-identical pins —
 * the cross-lineage consistency check); the education/agriculture pins
 * moved by exactly the six new platform policy defaults.
